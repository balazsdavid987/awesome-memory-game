## Description

The repo contains a project started as a homework given by a company I was interviewing for. The task was to create a memory game from scratch in 5 hours. The time limit was enough to create a working prototype that satisfies the requirements but I had to make several shortcuts to finish in time (see commit 7d5238d for a snapshot). After the deadline I have renamed the project to "Awesome Memory Game" and made several technical and visual improvements.
